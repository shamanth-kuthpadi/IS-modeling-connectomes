# To Do

how well can I cluster into correct regions [open ended question]

also change node colors so that represent clusters/communities within the network [implementation] [DONE]

is there any advantage to identify brain regions using centrality measures over typical coordinate to region mapping? [open ended question]

actually code out the centrality, rather than just using networkx library functions [implementation]

plot distribution of the edge weights [DONE]

analyze the edge weight distributions [open ended question]
- I am finding that the distributions look very different for the average graph and the patient graphs, why could this be? [open ended question]

need to modularize code ASAP, it is an absolute mess [implementation]
